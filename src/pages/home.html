    Here I aim to build my personal space for self-expression through writing and UX
    design.<br />
    The starting point is inspired by
    <a href="https://wiki.nikiv.dev/" target="_blank">Everything I Know</a> by Nikita
    Voloboev, so if you like Encyclopontus I bet you're going to love that site.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will never be finished, but is rather meant to be an

    >
    <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden" target="_blank"
      >outlet for my thoughts</a
    >.<br />
    Thus, I hereby present it as is right now - <b>no more, no less</b>.

      The Garden is not structured to be read in a linear fashion, but rather explored by
      a curious mind.<br />
      Most pages can be reached from the navigation menu, but some are
      <a href="#loose-leaves">loose leaves</a>
      blowing in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most pages are marked with one of the following statuses to give a rough indication
      of how far they've grown in my eyes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-none">
      <li>
        ðŸŒ± - Seedling, just beginning to see the light of day, with a lot of growing to
        do!
      </li>
      <li>
        ðŸª´ - Planted pot, living a life of its own - nice enough to appreciate having in
        the garden, but has not yet flowered or gotten its final roots established
      </li>
      <li>ðŸŒ² - Tree, with roots enough to try the trial of time</li>
    </ul>

      For the choice of "tech stack", simplicity is the leading star. The vision from the
      start is a space where I can write formatted and hyperlinked texts without having to
      deal with dependency maintenance, compiling, building, and deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site is therefore, as of yet, written with
      <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank">htmxðŸ’œ</a> and
      <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> and is hosted on
      <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> as static files
      only.<br />
      Source code freely available on my
      <a href="https://github.com/bondii/Encyclopontus">GitHub repo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach lets me quickly get started with minimal setup while still allowing
      those sweet partial page updates and provides a wide range of design options, while
      Keeping It <i>Stupid</i> Simple.<br />
      I only have to commit HTML to the repo and GitHub Pages automatically deploys it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      So far this feels fantastic, and I'm excited to see if I can build any interesting
      UX using such a minimal setup.
      <!--
        As far as future additions to the tech stack goes, I'm interested in trying out
        <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/">AlpineJS</a> for client state management, as it ties
        in with the minimal approach of htmx.
