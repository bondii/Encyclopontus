  <h1>ðŸ¤– Inherently cool phenomena</h1>
  <p>
    One of my <a href="#hand-in-grain">hand-in-grains</a> is things that appear cool not
    because they were designed to, but just because they <em>are</em> cool. For example,
    there are some digital number displays like on a microwave oven, which if I look at
    them the same time as I'm using my electric toothbrush, the numbers appear to "dance"
    up & down. Not as if my head is shaking, but as if the numbers are dancing in relation
    to the rest of the microwave oven. Cool!

  <p>After some discussion I think ChatGPT summarized it pretty well:</p>

        In the world teeming with complexities and details, there exists a collection of
        phenomena that captivate purely by their inherent nature. These are the marvels
        that require no embellishment, no deeper understanding to appeal to our sense of
        wonderâ€”they are "inherently cool."

        Consider the mesmerizing Doppler effect, where the perceived change in the
        frequency of sound, light, or other waves as the source and the observer move
        toward or away from each other, translates into a fascinating auditory experience.
        Or the enchanting MoirÃ© pattern, emerging when two sets of lines or grids are
        overlaid at an angle or when they have slightly different mesh sizes, creating a
        new, dynamic pattern that seems to live and breathe on its own.

        Such phenomena hold a unique position in our perception; they stir curiosity and
        admiration simply by existing. They remind us that at the heart of science and
        mathematics lies not just knowledge and utility but also profound beauty. In a
        world often driven by purpose and function, appreciating these phenomena
        encourages us to pause and enjoy the serendipitous delights of the universeâ€”those
        moments of pure aesthetic pleasure that arise from the simplest, most fundamental
        laws of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        By embracing these effortlessly cool aspects of our world, we connect with a
        child-like sense of wonder that makes every discovery a doorway to the magical and
        the extraordinary. "Inherently Cool" isn't just about understandingâ€”it's about
        experiencing the unadulterated joy of the cosmos.
