  I can both exaggerate and downplay this trip while being 100% sincere.<br />
  In one way I allowed myself slack to not push without wanting to, and I know I could
  have experienced even more than I did.
  <p>
    At the same time, it has been one of the most profound and perspective changing
    experiences of my life.

    <b>TL;DR: </b> I want to build a life in which I can experience different perspectives
    and parts of the world. But for me, in the end, people are what ultimately matters the
    most, especially for a well-rounded everyday life.<br />
    It has been both amazing and challenging, and I don't think travelling like this is
    for everyone.
    <p>
      I am motivated to learn Spanish in preparation for future adventures, and want to
      explore more of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      For You who <i>is</i> interested in trying it Yourself, I wholeheartedly recommend
      making it happen. It can be incredibly rewarding.

  <h3 class="mt-6">Humbling</h3>
  Stepping out of my comfort zone has been very humbling. I consider myself decent in
  living my life as an adult, being able to entertain myself, be interested and active in
  the world, get my job done, socialize, speak English, meet new people, etc. I was
  looking forward to the challenge I assumed this trip would be, and it has indeed matched
  my expectations in this regard. Not having my routines and social circle to fall back on
  has opened up for a lot of self-reflection and re-evaluation of what I appreciate in
  life.
  <p>
    It has been an interesting experience to both talk mainly English, with an audience
    varying from Americans to people barely speaking English at all, as well as not
    speaking the local language. I have a new perspective on being an outsider, including
    how obviously different I have felt compared to the natives.
  </p>

  <h3>Club Culture</h3>
  Dancing is one of the best ways I have of shaking up tensions, stress, and built-up
  feelings. Just letting go and moving my body by instinct with nothing in my head other
  than the music is such a liberating experience. Having a safe place for doing this
  together with a bunch of others is something I value both as an individual and as an
  important part of my Modern Tribe life, and it has been an incredible experience to
  connect with my Psytribe abroad when solo-travelling, being more welcomed and taken care
  of than I ever could have expected.
  <p>
    Berlin's club life has a special place in my heart. The culture, openness, freedom of
    expression, and community there is in my experience completely unprecedented in other
    parts of the world, possibly apart from temporary festivals. What I realized though is
    that even if the Berlin club venues are their own league with quality easily
    comparable to festivals, for me the culture is what sets it apart In Barcelona I went
    to a less extravagant club, but with a crowd on the same level as the ones in Berlin,
    and I had just as much fun. I think the culture is what's important, and with proper
    culture eventually societal acceptance & quality venues will follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, as of writing this, I feel motivated to be a part of building such a culture
    wherever I call home, rather than using as a motivation to move. Gothenburg is blessed
    in the sense of an unproportionally big underground scene in relation to citizens, and
    I would love if we could continue building this community and proper PLUR culture.
    With that being said, I don't think I would want to live somewhere that doesn't have
    <em>any</em> psytrance / techno scene.
  </p>

  <h3>Weather & winter outdoor possibilities</h3>
  Spending January/February in Barcelona opened my eyes for spending time outdoors all
  year around. Yes, there are winter activities like cross-country skiing etc., but being
  able to have a t-shirt day in the sun every now and then is a want I guess I had
  suppressed under the guise of
  <i>"lighting candles to fight the darkness & cold is cozy"</i>. I very seriously ponder
  if in the long run, depending on how the friendship clique develops, I might want to
  live the the majority of at least my winters somewhere with a tad more sun present.

  <h3>Living with others vs. on my own / renting a room</h3>
  The first place in Berlin was a room in an apartment shared with 1-3 others. I was not
  particularly keen on living with others, but it seemed like the best available option
  with such a short notice. I lucked out and ended up with one of the most welcoming and
  hospitable people I've ever met, which really made the start of my trip the best it
  could have been. He completely changed my feeling about renting a room like that, from
  "a cheaper way to rent a nicer place" into "a no-pressure social interaction &
  connection without any strings pre-attached".

  <p>
    This made me actively look for a room in a shared flat in Barcelona, with the hope of
    finding a glimpse into the life of a native. This also ended up as a positive
    experience, and made me reconsider renting out a room in my apartment. I am
    conceptually sold on the idea of meeting new people and cultures in this way, and
    after my stays I have lots of ideas on how to create a comfortable living situation
    for a guest in my room. I also want to try and give back a little of the positives I
    got from my hosts, Ã  la karma.
  </p>

  <h3>Experiencing new culture</h3>
  I think it's hard to really get a feel for what it's like living somewhere from this
  short time at each place. I do however definitely feel I got a glimpse of it, especially
  through socializing with my hosts and their friends, and that there is a major
  difference in vibe and feeling of living at each place. But in the end this ended up
  being more a taste of a few cities rather than settling in one and building some kind of
  base, and I would therefore still like to try moving to a single place for at least a
  year. Right now Barcelona is the main contender, but right now I also feel 0 stress to
  get that ball rolling, and would rather establish my Fort in Gothenburg.

  <h3>The important things in life</h3>
  I went through a couple of phases during this trip, from thinking that I might want to
  travel full-time for a longer while, wanting to live a year in Barcelona, questioning
  why I didn't miss my friends, to becoming saturated with adventure and longing more for
  the comfort of my Fort in Gothenburg, including apartment, friends, & family. I have
  felt
  <i>alive</i> and like I'm <em>actively</em> living, in a way that's hard to put into
  words. I have felt alone but never lonely, re-evaluated cornerstones of my life, been
  excited to the point of exhaustion, and gone full-circle living isolated just working
  from when I woke up in the morning until I fell asleep at night.

  <p>
    I am curious as to whether it's possible to create more of this "alive"-feeling
    through the way one lives life and spends ones days. I have a feeling that the
    illusion of the hamster wheel can at least be partially broken out of by creating
    situations and experiences similar to when being somewhere new, but this is yet to be
    proven.
  </p>

  <p>
    My eyes have been opened for travelling, and I will try my best to refresh the feeling
    of being <em><u>alive</u></em> whenever it fades, but I have also found a deeper
    appreciation for the life I have back home, and now actively feel I do want to live
    there.
  </p>

  <h2>Now what?</h2>
  Right now I'm motivated to continue building my life at home, focusing on relationships,
  work, and decorating my home. I am grateful for feeling saturated with travelling &
  adventuring, and want to see what parts of this experience I can try to integrate into
  my everyday life.
  <p>
    I plan on trying to learn Spanish, and have a loose future plan on living one year in
    Barcelona, but I'm going to let this idea sprout before I plant it.
