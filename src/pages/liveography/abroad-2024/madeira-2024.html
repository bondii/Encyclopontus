  <h1>Madeira ~ 2024-03-01 -> 2024-04-02</h1>

  <section class="border-b-0">
    Madeira is so far my favorite semester location of all time. AMAZING hikes along the
    levadas, lots of varied landscapes, great weather, super cozy winding roads up the
    mountains and along the coast.

      One necessary caveat though: The island feels <b>very</b> touristy and is highly
      exploited. You will not at all feel like you're in proper wilderness, compared to
      e.g. the Swedish mountains. That being said, I would never experience this type of
      nature if it was not accessible in this way, and for a <i>semester location</i> I
      personally don't mind this as the high level of tourism makes it more comfortable
      and easy e.g. finding information about trekking routes, renting a scooter, etc. In
      fact, this accessibility is what makes me consider it my favorite semester location,
      as the stay was mostly pure enjoyment and free from hassles, while letting me
      experience an entirely new type of biome.
