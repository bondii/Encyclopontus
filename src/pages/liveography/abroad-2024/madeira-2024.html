  <h1>Madeira ~ 2024-03-01 -> 2024-04-02</h1>

      Madeira is so far my favorite semester location of all time. Starting with the most
      necessary caveat: The island is very touristy and highly exploited. You will not
      feel like you're in proper wilderness, compared to e.g. the Swedish mountains. That
      being said, as a <i>semester</i> location I personally don't mind this, and rather
      find the high level of tourism makes it more comfortable and easy to e.g. rent a
      scooter and find information about where to find trekking routes etc. In fact, this
      accessibility is what makes me consider it my favorite semester location, as the
      stay was mostly pure enjoyment and free from hassles.
