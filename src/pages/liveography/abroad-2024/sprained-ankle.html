      Berlin, <time>2024-01-09 07:10</time> ~ 5 min before the Metro to the airport leaves
    </div>
    <p>
      I've just gotten to the metro, and after dilly-dallying a minute decide to buy a
      coffe: <i>I have time</i>. Wait for the coffee a minute or two, get it, and start
      walking again. Didn't even put the bags down, no need for such a short wait.
    </p>
    <h4>28kg in the backpack on my back, 8kg in the one on my stomach,</h4>
    it sure is a bit heavy, but I'm managing. The 10 minute walk from the apartment this
    early in the Berlin New Years Cold was waay worse, so I've already checked off the
    worst!

    <p>
      <b>In the stairs down to the metro</b> I realize that the metro ticket I usually buy
      doesn't cover the trip to the airport. Friick frik frick <i>friiiick</i> I havn't
      heard about the German <i>fahrkartenkontrolleure</i> being particularly
      <u>understanding</u> in these situations!!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a coffee in the one hand I fiddle in my pocket with the other and take up my
      phone and start searching for which ticket I need
    </p>

    ...and I misstep

      <b>I made it to Barcelona.</b> I take it slow the day of arrival; just a small walk
      in the evening to buy the necessities: food and alcohol. Then rest and a little walk
      the day after that. The weekend comes and the foot is slowly feeling a bit better,
      even though it's sad every time I use it (which I do for a bit, daily...).
    </p>
    <p>
      I figure it's just a badly sprained ankle, for which I'm told some motion is only
      good to not let it stiffen up.<br />
      I bike to a small hill nearby and walk up, but I probably shouldn't have as the days
      after it got worse again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm starting to realize it probably isn't just a sprain but maybe a (small,
      <span class="text-sm">hopefully</span>) fracture too.<br />
      Anyway, although slowly improving again, it's still not good now after two weeks..

    <h3>Final update: All is well!</h3>
    <p>
      After beginning to think there was a fracture, I felt I needed to get it x-rayed at
      the hospital - if it would be fractured then I should take rest seriously for the
      foreseeable future, while if only sprained I should actually use it to recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo and behold, there was no fracture!!ðŸŽ‰ I started using it as much as possible
      without causing pain, and before the next weekend it was starting to feel better for
      real!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lesson learned:</b> If you get hurt, take it seriously and get it checked
      immediately if it does not improve within a couple of days. It's worth knowing what
      is actually going on so you can treat it accordingly.
