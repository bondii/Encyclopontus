  <h1>ðŸª´ Abroad Living 2024</h1>

    <p>
      I met this person who was <i>passionate</i> about travelling, and basically always
      had the next trip in mind as a savings motivation. She had been <i>around</i>, and
      sold me completely on getting first-hand experiences of new cultures and ways of
      living!
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought of new <i>perspectives</i> on life and how you spend your time in the
      world kinda stuck with me. We are, after all, very socially and environmentally
      influenced beings, so obviously the culture and environment you live in will affect
      how you think, act, and feel.

      I have lived basically my whole life in my hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden (yes,
      MÃ¶lndal included). I had one year in Lund, when I together with my first girlfriend
      both moved from home for the first time, ultimately leading to a year lo

      ng final fallout between us. While I <em>did</em> enjoy moving to Lund, I can't
      really say I got to <i>experience</i> what it was like living somewhere else.
    </p>
    <h3>Don't get me wrong, I love Gothenburg!</h3>
    <p>
      Most of all, I have my parents and most of my closest friends still living there, as
      well as my colleagues. As I feel right now I really would not mind living my entire
      life in Gothenburg, but exactly because of that reason I feel I need to try
      something else:<br />
      <b>Big decisions should not be passive choices.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      I have the best group of friends I could imagine in Gothenburg, and I for one enjoy
      going to the office to spend my working days together with my colleagues. My parents
      living within an hour is also appreciated. Hence, I would be more than glad to stay.
      It's easiest, it's where all my relations are, it's where I've built my life,
      including my job and apartment. If anything I'm <i>afraid</i> of falling in love
      with another city, or even worse, a lady in one... But for such a big decision as
      where to live it should be worth comparing the alternatives and at least making an
      <u>active</u> choice to stay.

    When I found myself single after being in relationships for my entire transition from
    teenager to adult, I felt I had no choice but to try moving <i>somewhere</i>. I also
    felt stressed as I struggled with balancing all my wants and needs, so I was hoping
    that by getting some distance from it all I could get a chance to feel a little
    lonely, possibly bored, and to miss my friends and ordinary life.
    <p>
      I considered Stockholm, Berlin, Amsterdam, Vienna, and Barcelona. I decided against
      Stockholm as if I was going to try moving, I might as well do it abroad. Barcelona
      was the most appealing because of bigger cultural difference, but also felt a little
      far. Berlin felt like the best compromise, providing interesting culture coupled
      with being conveniently easy to get to by night train. I barely had a plan, but I
      had got an OK from my job, I had a Berlin apartment to move into, and tried to stay
      calm thinking "What's the worst that can happen?".
    </p>

    <p>
      Without going into boring details, my apartment plan failed, followed by the next
      apartment plan failing as well. To get started and at least get to Berlin I decided
      to re-pack a bit lighter, get an AirBnB to just get there, and to later see what I
      wanted to do next. But at this point I started thinking I might as well just travel
      light and try out a few different cities instead of living in just one, seeing as I
      didn't have an apartment anyways. Hence, in the end the route became Berlin ->
      Barcelona -> Porto -> Madeira -> Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I've never done anything like this before, I decided to set no expectations
      for myself. Just being abroad would be enough, and if I had no energy or push to do
      anything other than work, that would be fine. The main idea was to get some feeling
      for living somewhere else, so I wanted to stay at least a month to get some kind of
      feel for life at each place.
