  <h1>ðŸª´ Abroad Living 2024</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
      I met this person a couple of times who was <i>passionate</i> about travelling, and
      basically always had the next trip in mind as a savings motivation. She had been
      <i>around</i>, and it reeally sounded like a lot of fun to get first-hand experience
      of new cultures and ways of living!
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought of new <i>perspectives</i> on life and how you spend your time in the
      world kinda stuck with me. We are, after all, very socially and environmentally
      influenced biological beings, so obviously the culture and environment you live in
      will affect how you think, act, and feel.

      I have lived basically my whole life in my hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden (yes,
      MÃ¶lndal included). I had one year in Lund, when I together with my first girlfriend
      both moved from home together for the first time, ultimately leading to a year lo<i

      ><i class="text-[10px]">o</i><i class="text-[6px]">o</i>ng final fallout between us
      two. While I did enjoy moving and Lund, I can't really say I got to
      <i>experience</i> what it was like living somewhere else.
    </p>
    <h3>Don't get me wrong, I love Gothenburg!</h3>
    <p>
      Most of all, I have my parents and most of my closest friends still living there, as
      well as my colleagues. As I feel right now I really would not mind living my entire
      life in Gothenburg, and exactly because of that reason I feel I need to try
      something else.

    <h2>Big decisions should not be passive choices</h2>
    <p>
      I have the best group of friends I could imagine in Gothenburg, and I for one enjoy
      going to the office to spend my working days together with my colleagues. My parents
      living within an hour is also appreciated.
    </p>

    <h1 class="mt-8">Let me be 100% clear: I <b>want</b> to stay in Gothenburg</h1>
    <p>
      It's easiest, it's where all my relations are, it's where I've built my life,
      including my job and apartment. If anything I'm <i>afraid</i> of falling in love
      with another city, or even worse, a lady in one... But for such a big decision as
      where to live it should be worth comparing the alternatives and at least making an
      <u>active</u> choice to stay.
