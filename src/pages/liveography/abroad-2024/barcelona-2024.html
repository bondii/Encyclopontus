  <h2>Life in Barcelona</h2>
  <p>
    Honestly just living in a city with this climate in the winter, with a culture that

    beaches...

    I embarked on these mere six months mostly hoping to have a good time and get some new
    experiences and inspirations for future travels. Naturally, it was a lot of fun...
    Possibly... Too fun to live without...

  <p>I left Berlin thinking:</p>
  <blockquote>
    It feels good to leave knowing I'm coming back to finish with something I liked! Then
    I can also give it a final feel before I'm back home again...

  <p>I leave <i>Barcelona</i> thinking:</p>
  <blockquote>
    It feels good to leave knowing I'm coming back for a whole year next time!
