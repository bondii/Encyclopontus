    I <i>did</i> expect to like Barcelona, but not <b>this much</b>, honestly...

    <h2>Street feeling</h2>
    <p>I walk through the streets and I think:</p>
    <blockquote>
      What a cute little street, with cute little shops and elegant architecture!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There's a mix of old and young people on the streets, talking, throwing balls,
      taking pictures, lauging, sitting by themselves, enjoying the sun. It almost feels
      like I'm in some kind of game world or movie set, just that it's not as "perfect" as
      those memories...
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I must have gotten straight into one of the best parts of the city!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ...but each street is similarly interesting, with its own variations. Here and
      there's some obviously touristy souvenir shop, and here and there's some really nice
      or useful
      <i>boutique</i>, like a fruit shop, or a

      asian store.
    </p>
    <p>
      I keep walking and the streets keep changing with new things to see and I realize,
      "this" is not the "best part" of the Barcelona,
      <span class="relative italic hover-trigger">
        this <b>is</b> Barcelona!
        <img src="/static/whatever_man.gif" class="absolute hidden hover-target w-52" />
      </span>
    </p>
    <h4>I'm probably just romanticizing some kind of honeymoon phase feeling</h4>
    but I <b>do</b> know I have never had such a nice feeling the instant I was walking in
    a city, which then <i>endured</i> for (so far) the whole stay!

    <h2>Life in Barcelona</h2>
    <p>
      I was afraid I would like a city too much, and this might just be it, not gonna lie.
      <i>Living</i> in a city with this climate in winter, with a <b>welcoming</b> culture
      (generally), with nature so close it's always in line of sight, with multiple niiice
      beaches... It's hard <b>not</b> to like it.

<!-- Oh, so you're a nosy mf? Well then, here's some sneak peek into what's coming!.. -->

    I embarked on these mere six months mostly hoping to have a good time and get some new
    experiences and inspirations for future travels. Naturally, it was a lot of fun...
    Possibly... Too fun to live without...
  </p>
  <p>I left Berlin thinking:</p>
  <blockquote>
    It feels good to leave knowing I'm coming back to finish with something I liked! Then
    I can also give it a final feel before I'm back home again...
  </blockquote>
  <p>I leave <i>Barcelona</i> thinking:</p>
  <blockquote>
    It feels good to leave knowing I'm coming back for a whole year next time!
