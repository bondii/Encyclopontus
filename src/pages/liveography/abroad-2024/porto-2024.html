  <h1>Porto ~ 2024-02-13 -> 2024-03-01</h1>

      I have been to Portugal four times before, but only for going to festivals and not
      to enjoy the country itself. Sure, we've stayed in Airbnb's out on the countryside
      just 100% relaxing and recovering after a week of partying, but this has only left
      me with a taste for actually experiencing the country, not any real feel for how it
      is.

      Hence when my sister got the keys to her apartment in Porto and invited me to come
      stay with her, it was an obvious yes.

    Porto is a really cozy city, with very varied city parts and views. Amazing waves both
    for watching and surfing. Iconic bridges over the beautiful wide river, with cute
    houses all over the steep slope down to the water. Elegant luxurious small houses
    right next to battered abandoned ones. A countryside with jungle-isch vibes (<i
      >in the eyes of a northerner</i
    >) and picturesque stone villages which leaves me both wondering how people even live
    there as well as want to try it out myself.

      All in all I had a great time, finding some quiet for relaxation and soft
      exploration of the city, as well as good focus for my work.<br />
      Well needed after the month in Barcelona!

      ...but most of all, I got the opportunity to reconnect with my sister after way too
      long with barely any contact, which meant the world to me beyond what I can put into
      wordsðŸ’œ
