  <h1>üå± Meditation</h1>
  <p>
    Like with so many other things, I had a skeptical view of meditation before I was
    properly introduced to it. Admittedly, I had not spent much time thinking or reading
    about it: I considered it a religious / spiritual / New Age kind of activity, where
    with a strong intention one could manifest internal feelings of peace (so far so good,
    right?), while it did not actually do any more good than watching TV (...right).
  </p>
  <p>Yes, like so many others I've met, I thought</p>
  <blockquote>
    <u>My</u> meditation is to relax / sit in the sauna /
    <code class="not-italic">&ltinsert src="w/e/chill.activity" /&gt</code>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    One day a close friend of mine whom I already back then respected deeply and
    considered to be a reasonable rationalist, said he had started practicing meditation,
    and that he
    <i>really</i> liked it. He gave a great brief introduction to what it was about, but
    most importantly, he said that there are scientific studies showing that, without any
    spiritual layers added to it,
    <i>there are actual positive biophysical & mental effects</i> from meditation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now this was enough to get me interested. I had prior to this come to terms with an
    atheistic world view without any spiritual layers, but at the same time with a respect
    for the subjective experience of a complicated world. I believed, and still do today,
    that some parts or aspects of life / the world / the Human Experience are most easily
    described in terms of "energies", <i>Feng Shui</i>, "vibrations in the fabric of our
    universe", etc. To me these are metaphors, often for subjective psychological
    patterns, but not literary projections of reality.<br />
    In short, I was open to the <i>intention</i> and possible <i>outcome</i> of some
    spiritual and religious ideas and practices, without them necessarily being tied to
    anything "supernatural".

  <h2 class="bold">Meditation seemed like just such a thing!</h2>
  <p class="bold">I gave it a go.</p>
  <p>
    I have since realized there are different types and niches of meditation practices;
    the one I started with and have been doing since is probably amongst the more barebone
    / minimal ones. I sit with eyes closed and try to let my focus stay on (<i
      >& after wandering consequently return to</i
    >) my breath, and if thoughts come into my awareness (which is <i>not</i> the same as
    focus and hence <u>in no way</u> what haters would call a "failure"), I shall, unlike
    Gandalf, <i>let them pass</i>.
  </p>

    I struggled a lot. It was very hard, and at first not something I really enjoyed. I
    <b>did</b> however have some kind of calm feeling afterwards, which was not more than
    possibly placebo, but still something. My friend lent me a book called
    <i>The Mind Illuminated</i>, written by Culadasa (John Yates). A book which, like many
    others, I really enjoyed but have yet to finish. One of the key things it pushed for
    hard early is to <i>make</i> the practice something positive in your mind. Don't get
    worked up when things don't go your way, when your mind wanders again and again, when
    you fall asleep, or when you just don't find inner peace. You tried, and that's good
    enough. In fact, I noticed quite quickly that I, chronically stressed as I am, at
    least enjoyed having "my <i>X</i> minutes" where nothing else mattered than
    <b>Here & NowÔ∏è</b>. <i>Y</i> years later it is something I try to do at least once
    every day, and aim for finding a routine for thrice a day. To say I like it is an
    understatement.
