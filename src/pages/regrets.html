  <h1>ðŸª´ Regrets</h1>
    A phrase I've heard often, especially during my teenage years, is
    <blockquote>Have no regrets - the bad experiences are part of who you are today!</blockquote>
    <p>
      While I do agree with the meaning, I think this should be switched around, and that instead of having no regrets we should honor them:</p>

      <p>
      It's not the <i>experience</i> of doing something I later regret that has made me who I am;<br>
      <b>It is he feeling of regret that has made me change my behavior.</b>

    Right around when I turned 15 I got into my first relationship. I was overwhelmed and
    inexperienced, as was she: in hindsight it was a toxic relationship for both parts,
    and I certainly played my role.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some parts were fantastic and I learned a LOT from positive moments and interactions
    with her, but I also have lots of regrets from that time; for how I treated myself,
    her, and others in my life. A big part of the problem was my lack of prior
    experiences, and I remember that I from the start thought:
    <blockquote class="mb-3">This is my major chance of having a girlfriend, I
    <i>need</i> to <b>make</b> this work!</blockquote>
    ...Not a great base for a healthy relationship built on constructive feedback and mutual respect..

    A year or two before this I had gotten contact with a friend's friend, who I had been
    texting with and subsequently had a crush on. This wasn't just "oh a girl, I'm in
    love!!", though: I really enjoyed texting with her, her inputs on questions, her
    humour, everything about her, I honestly was kind of in love... If only I had told her
    how I felt, I think there's at least a chance she would have had some feelings for me
    as well, or maybe they could have flowered, but I had never had a girlfriend at this
    point and my <a href="https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Initiative" class="italic">Initiative</a> was still at Zer0. Insecure as I was, I was completely sure I
    was just a lunatic boy with strong feelings that she would never reciprocate, so I
    didn't want to risk ruining our friendship. Hence, nothing happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fast-forward a year or two again and I was in my first relationship. I had told her
    about how I had had feelings for this girl previously (all while lying about said
    feelings being complete gone), and she did not like me spending time texting her,
    especially when I was hanging out with my girlfriend. Mind you, this was at a time
    when SMSing was <b><i>the</i> thang</b>: I texted people almost 24/7, even when hanging out with
    others. Still, I can see why it was not appreciated that I spent my time texting this
    other girl, whom I had admitted to ("previously"ðŸ™„) having feelings for. My GF brought
    it up a couple of times, which always led to a fight as I reasoned there was no harm
    done, while our communication was not good enough to make her feel heard and assured.
    I was a huuge wimp with a fear of conflicts (read: no relationship experience), so eventually I
    bulged and simply never responded to this other girl.

    <h2 class="mt-6">I ghosted her</h2>
    <p>
      For many years I blamed my (then) GF for making me do this. However with the years
      and some distance from it, it was clearly 100% my decision: she did not ask me to
      ghost her, and when asked about it later I lied that "we lost contact".<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I ghosted who I just a year before considered almost my best friend, and who probably could have
      been.
    </p>
    <h3>I am the one responsible what I did</h3>
    <p>
      This is without a doubt the single greatest regret of my life, and I value this as
      one of the most influential life lessons I have had.

    <h4 class="pb-4 my-3">Now what?</h4>
    <blockquote class="my-3">Contact her!</blockquote>
    <p class="pt-1">
      A couple of years back I did contact her again, and she agreed to meet over lunch.
      It was super nice and we talked about lots, but stupid as I was I didn't bring up
      the main conversation!!.. When we were leaving it came up and she asked why I did
      what I did, and without having the proper time to explain I gave a really bad <i>"it
      was my girlfriend at the time who was jealous"</i> excuse, taking no responsibility for
      my actions...
    </p>
    <p>
      I know she has moved on with her life and I feel it's only egoistical to make
      contact again, even if I would want nothing else.
    </p>
  </section>
   <p class="mt-10 italic">
      If you're her friend and you think she would appreciate contact with me again, PLEASE make it happen...
    </p>
    I feel I potentially missed a BFFL; this is the only thing I would want to try and change, no other expectations.
