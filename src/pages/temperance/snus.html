  <h2>ðŸª´ Snus</h2>
  <p>
    I was raised with the indoctrination that all indulgence which is not societally
    accepted as "healthy", is inherently (at least indirectly) bad.<br />
    This meant alcohol and all other drugs, staying up late, gaming, watching movies,
    eating junk food or candy, etc. If this was the intention of my parents or not,
    nothing else considered this is rougly the view I as a late teen/early adult felt had
    been pushed upon me.
  </p>
  <p>
    As most of us do when we grow up, I started pushing the boundaries of this: staying up
    late playing games, drinking alcohol, eating cookies, and I even started smoking
    cigarettes when partying. At a certain point, the modest way of thinking was put in
    the box of "opinions old people hold as they no longer enjoy life and can't relate to
    why younger people would want to".
  </p>
  <p>I myself, woke AF, thought something along the lines of:</p>
  <blockquote class="mb-2">
    Yes, it is important to consider the negative effects of ones indulgences, but they
    should be weighed against the positives, and not blindly shunned because of the
    downsides.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I did not smoke cigarettes for long, though, as the positive effect was simply not
    enough to justify the negative health effects. I <i>did enjoy</i>
    smoking though, and eventually tried finding an alternative source of nicotine. If
    anyone has the same bad idea I had I can save you some trouble: nicotine chewing gums
    just don't cut it for recreational use. Enter snus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Snus are nicotine pouches that you put under your lip, popular in Sweden. I had stayed
    away from snus as I had heard it to be very easy to feel sick from it, not realizing
    how intoxicated you are until it's too late and you have to puke. However, after being
    let down by the nicotine chewing gums I was ready to give it a go.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, as I think for me personally think is the most dangerous type of addictive agent,
    snus is not really <i>that</i> enjoyable. Smoking cigarettes is awesome, both the
    physical act and the psychoactive effects, but snus is merely <i>niice</i>. The
    tobacco free snus was tasty and did not feel as junky as the OG tobacco version, gave
    an actual headspin from the nicotine, and as long as I took it out for a pause as soon
    as my head started spinning the least bit, I managed to avoid feeling all too bad.
  </p>
  <p>
    I now realize <i>habitual</i> indulgence alters ones world view. We are biological
    beings driven by mainly unconscious processes, and even though we should not go
    <i>against</i> our <b>instincts</b>, it seems to me like we can not trust them
    passively either. Instead, we must through personal experience learn how to
    <i>listen</i> to them them, after which we should make
    <b>rational, conscious</b> decisions <i>based</i> on them <u>in conjunction</u> with
    our factual knowledge and <b>logical reasoning</b>.
