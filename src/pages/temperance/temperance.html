        <b>Temperance</b> is a term that traditionally refers to moderation or
        self-restraint in one's actions, habits, or desires, especially with regard to
        indulgence in pleasures or consumption of intoxicating substances. The word
        originates from the Latin <i>temperantia</i>, meaning moderation or self-control.

        I chose "Temperance" as the title for your text because it encapsulates the
        central theme of balancing between giving in to urges and practicing restraint.
        This concept is not just about abstaining from these activities altogether, but
        rather about finding a healthy, moderate approach to them. It suggests a mindful
        and balanced way of living where one is conscious of the consequences of their
        actions and chooses moderation over excess or complete denial. The title is
        succinct yet comprehensive, covering the broad spectrum of behaviors and choices
        you aim to explore in your text[s].

      I <i>love</i> life and all it has to offer, and truly do believe in attempting to
      "<i>maxxa livet</i>", which at one period in my life meant doing basically whatever
      I wanted, whenever I wanted, exemplified by me becoming addicted to
      <a href="#snus">snus</a>.

      Surprise surprise, this was terrible. Terribly insightful, as well, hÃ¶hÃ¶, but
      definitely something I'm glad to have gotten out of.

      After becoming addicted to nicotine, and subsequently recovering completely, I have
      again adjusted my belief. I now think one has to make a sober, rational, conscious
      choice of where to find the balance, based on ones personal experience with said
      indulgence, as we are all individual beings who all are affected in more or less
      different ways, by all things in life.
