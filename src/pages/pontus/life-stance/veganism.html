    Without going into details, I think the way animals are treated in the modern food
    industry is one of the darkest and most shameful parts of humans throughout history.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe one of the most human attributes is the ability to make choices based on
    rational reasoning.<br />
    I also personally believe one of humankind's goals (as well as each individual's)
    should be to reduce suffering in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    These two together with (based on what I've read and experienced) the fact that it is
    not only <i>possible</i> but actually quite <i>easy</i> to to live a healthy happy
    life on a plant-based diet, I don't see any option but to.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have tried but think it's very hard to try and talk about this on my own initiative.
    Even if my conscious motivation is a need to share thoughts and deeper feelings in
    order to connect with others, I realize my feelings on this subject are so strong that
    it's practically impossible to hold a neutral
    <i>"I don't care what you do, but this is how I think"</i> tone when talking about it,
    and always tend to heavily imply that I think it is morally non-optional, even if
    that's not how I want to express myself. This naturally easily leads to the listener
    falling into more of a defensive stance. Hence,
    <b>I try to be an example of that it <em>is</em> indeed possible</b>, but these days
    almost exclusively talk about it when asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    With such a deeply societally rooted situation, I don't think change will come (fast
    enough) without being as absolute as feels personally reasonable. Ultimately I do care
    about change happening, and I feel each and every participation in the animals-as-food
    world is a continued normalization of what I consider ethically unreasonable.
