  <h1>ðŸŒ± Future Pontus</h1>
  <p>
    Future Pontus is the best, always taking care of things
    <a href="#pontus/present-pontus" class="italic text-violet-50 hover:text-violet-50"
      >I</a
    >
    just <i>CBAaaaarsed</i> doing myself in the forseeable future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only negative thing about Future Pontus is that he's sometimes a tad harsh on
    <a href="#pontus/past-pontus">Past Pontus</a>, as if Past Pontus did <i>not</i> do his
    best, should have "<i>known better</i>", or "<i
      >just not post-poned <code>&ltw/e&gt</code> <u>indefinitely</u></i
    >
    "... Easy to say with 20/20 hindsight!
  </p>
  <p>
    But honestly, it's mostly because he cares and would have wished Past Pontus a couple
    of better turns here and there... By now I have understood that Future Pontus is in
    some ways similar to that b*tch karma we keep hearing about: if I'm nice to him when I
    can, he often pays it back and rewards me with a good time and pats on the back!
