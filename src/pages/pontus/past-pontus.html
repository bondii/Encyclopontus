  <h1>ðŸŒ± Past Pontus</h1>
  <p>
    Past Pontus has lately had a good track record of at least <i>trying</i> to do what's
    good for both him and <a href="#pontus/future-pontus">Future Pontus</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    He gets a lot of shit from Future Pontus, which at times have led to them temporarily
    falling out and Present Pontus having to step in and give Future Pontus the finger,
    just to show who's boss just yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only negative thing about Future Pontus is that he's sometimes so harsh on Past
    Pontus, as if Past Pontus did not do his best and should have "<i>known better</i>" or
    "<i>just not post-poned <code>&ltw/e&gt</code> <u>indefinitely</u></i> "... Easy to
    say with 20/20 hindsight!
