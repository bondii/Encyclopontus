  <h1>ðŸŒ± Past Pontus</h1>
  <p>
    Past Pontus has lately had a good track record of at least <i>trying</i> to do what's
    good for both him and <a href="#pontus/future-pontus">Future Pontus</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    He gets a lot of shit from Future Pontus, which at times have led to them temporarily
    falling out and Present Pontus having to step in and give Future Pontus the finger,
    just to show who's boss just yet.
