    I hold a Secular Humanistic philosophy, with a touch of
    <a href="https://www.snsociety.org/about-sns/what-is-spiritual-naturalism/"
      >Spiritual Naturalism</a
    >. I consider myself relatively deeply atheistic and a tad anti-religious, as from my
    point of view religion (or to be fair, "blind fundamentalist"-isch religion) has
    caused and continues to cause too much suffering around the world to be worth the
    positives it does have, compared to holding a purely humanistic world view. I do
    however strongly believe in freedom of religion; nobodies understanding of the world
    should be <i>forced</i>. I'm therefore absoltely not talking about banning religion,
    but rather pushing education and discussion regarding its place in society, past and
    modern.

    With this being said, I think humans are spiritual by nature. I think the willingness
    to believe in and worship a higher power, which is so widespread throughout the entire
    world, is a biological sociological strategy which helps us find mental balance and
    build a communal sense of purpose. I think this has been vital to our social evolution
    as a species, and much like enjoyment from art is not something we should necessarily
    shun just because "it has no tangible objective value".

    I am deeply fascinated by the world we are living in. Everything from the wonderful
    feeling of seeing an extraordinary view of nature, to the weird behaviors and
    mathematical models of quantum mechanics and astrophysics, to the unanswered questions
    about the nature of consciousnes, to the doppler effect &
    <a href="#inherently-cool">how it is auditorily percieved by us</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The juxtaposition of how <em>complex</em> facts we have managed to empirically prove
    about this world, together with how much we now know that we have not figured out yet,
    leaves me with a sense of purpose for humanity as a whole. Understanding more has in
    many cases led to breakthroughs in standards of living and/or general health of more
    or less the entire population, leading to a positive spiral.

    <i>Every single one of us</i> is an <i>interested</i> being by nature, it's part of
    our DNA. If we managed to find a way to live together, say to start with through an
    abundance of cheap quality food & shelter & other basic human needs & rights, could we
    not unite simply under the awe of nature itself and the monumental task of trying to
    understand as much of it as humanly possible?
