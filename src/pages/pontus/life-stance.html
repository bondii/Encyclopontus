      I hold a Secular Humanistic philosophy, with a touch of
      <a href="https://www.snsociety.org/about-sns/what-is-spiritual-naturalism/"
        >Spiritual Naturalism</a
      >. I consider myself relatively deeply atheistic and a tad anti-religious, as from
      my point of view religion (or to be fair, "blind fundamentalist"-isch religion) has
      caused and continues to cause too much suffering around the world to be worth the
      positives it does have, compared to holding a purely humanistic world view. I do
      however strongly believe in freedom of religion; nobody's understanding of the world
      should be <i>forced</i>. I'm therefore absoltely not talking about banning religion,
      but rather pushing education and discussion regarding its place in society, past and
      modern.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this being said, I think humans are spiritual by nature. I think the
      willingness to believe in and worship a higher power, which is so widespread
      throughout the entire world, is a biological sociological strategy which helps us
      find mental balance and build a communal sense of purpose. I think this has been
      vital to our social evolution as a species, and much like enjoyment from art is not
      something we should necessarily shun just because "it has no tangible objective
      value".

    <h2>Altruism</h2>
    <p>
      At first it might be easy to assume egoism as the most natural behavior for
      individuals with free will. However, as is so eloquently shown by game theory
      (perfectly explored by Veritasum in his video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM">
        <i>What Game Theory Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything</i></a
      >), even egoistic agents can in certain systems benefit from "nice" strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of us have felt good about ourselves when we have been a help to someone else,
      and have probably joked about "<i
        >I'm doing this for selfish reasons, as it makes me feel like a good person!</i
      >" when doing something nice for someone.<br />
      Let's <b>cultivate</b> that feeling!
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that altruism is an innate biological instinct in humans developed by
      evolution. At the same time, I am humble before the fact that when push comes to
      shove, there are hardly any stronger drives than self-preservation. I therefore try
      to actively acknowledge that it is a privilege to even think about these things, and
      that from the perspective of a different human experience's reality these ideas
      might seem very naive and unrealistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, just as how I believe it should always be accepted to call out a problem
      without first having a solution, I think it is important to open up for discussions
      and dreams about these ideas, as I think finding common grounds for these questions
      is important for forming the Tribes of Modern Society.

    <h2>Secular Humanism</h2>
    <p>
      From a purely logical perspective, I think it makes sense to try and help those who,
      <b>for whatever reason,</b> need it, rather than improve the situation of those who
      already have a tolerable life. I do realize the complexity of this multi-dimensional
      topic; not the least with regards to A) avoiding an unfair advantage given to bad
      actors, as well as B) the problem of keeping high-value individuals & companies
      within the bounds of our system. With regards to getting to keep the return of the
      effort you put in, I don't think we are at a point in our society where this is
      actually fair, as we have a kind of snowball effect for the economic scale.
    </p>
    <h3>Universal Basic Income</h3>
    <p>
      I am not convinced neither for nor against UBI as a practical alternative on any
      wider scale as of today, but I am conceptually 100% on board. Giving everyone a
      fair'n'square option to just get by, opening up for a possibility of exploring ones
      own interests and motivations, is beyond beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's just dream for a second, about a world where we have automated practically all
      our basic needs such as growing food, handling waste, and producing energy. I don't
      think it is far-fetched to consider this a possibility in the forseeable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Now consider the possibility of Artificial Intelligence</b> as the fourth
      industrial revolution, replacing the need for humans for mental labor. What would we
      want to do, if not promote everyone finding their own purpose in life?

    <h2>Spiritual Naturalism</h2>
    <p>
      I am deeply fascinated by the world we are living in. Everything from the wonderful
      feeling of seeing an extraordinary view of nature, to the weird behaviors and
      mathematical models of quantum mechanics and astrophysics, to the unanswered
      questions about the nature of consciousnes, to the doppler effect &
      <a href="#inherently-cool">how it is auditorily perceived by us</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The juxtaposition of how <em>complex</em> facts we have managed to empirically prove
      about this world, together with how much we now know that we have not figured out
      yet, leaves me with a sense of purpose for humanity as a whole. Understanding more
      has in many cases led to breakthroughs in standards of living and/or general health
      of more or less the entire population, leading to a positive spiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Every single one of us</i> is an <i>interested</i> being by nature, it's part of
      our DNA. If we managed to find a way to live together (say, starting with an
      automation-driven abundance of cheap but quality food & shelter & other basic human
      needs), could we not unite simply under the awe of nature itself and the monumental
      task of trying to understand as much of it as humanly possible?
