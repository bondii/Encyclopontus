  <h2>üå± Mindfulness vs. Routine</h2>

  <p class="p-2 font-bold border-4 rounded-2xl text-violet-300 w-fit">
    Mindfulness is a means of being in control of your in-/actions and the lack
    of/consequences thereof.<br />
    Routines are tools to make life flow effortlessly, but they kill mindfulness as they
    cement neural connections.
  </p>

  <h2>Let me elaborate</h2>
  <p>
    I hypothesize that the positive effects and the appreciation of the subjective
    experience of ‚Äú<i>being present - here and now</i>‚Äù is due to letting the brain chill
    with its neural highways for some time, putting us more into control rather than
    auto-pilot. This is in line with the results showing an activation of the Default Mode
    Network during mindfulness, which if I remember correctly has been shown to be
    beneficial for forming new memories etc.,
    <i>but I need to find a source for that claim‚Ä¶</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    What happens e.g. when we go to a concert and hear some emotionally intense music and
    ‚Äú<i>really <u>feel</u> it</i>‚Äù is that we fire lots and lots of neural pathways
    representing those impressions, <u>effectively blocking out the ordinary loops</u>. I
    believe we experience some of this consciously, but that the conscious parts of this
    are just the tip of the iceberg, and that the <i>real</i> positive effects are from
    the <u>unconscious</u> parts of the same effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love routines as I feel I almost don't have to spend any

    but still get the positives of the actions my body is taking. However, I'm suspecting
    that this exact auto-pilot is what I like getting disabled in mindful moments, and
    therefore could be guilty of making subjective time shorter, as it's compressed into
    the same pathways as previous moments.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this is the case I don't think it's far fetched that routines
    <i>ad absurdum</i> also hinder creativity and action-taking potential, possibly
    contributing to getting stuck in local optimas, which is what I think is the cause of
    the hamster wheel-feeling.
