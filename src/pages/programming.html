  <h2>ðŸª´ Programming</h2>
  <p>
    I'm extremely grateful for being able work with as a software systems developer.
    Pretty early in elementary school I gravitated towards natural sciences, especially
    math with its clear rules and axiomatic reasoning. To me this felt easier to
    understand than the more nuanced and multi-faceted answers given in the social science
    subjects.

  <p>
    Logic based problem solving felt natural and like a fun puzzle, and as a young child I
    quickly saw this as a part of my identity: I'm a lousy writer, but I'll solve any math
    problem the teacher throws at me! I also had a very good teacher, Gunilla Fant Moe,
    for these subjects in 7th-9th grade, who made me feel acknowledged, actively pushed me
    to go beyond my current limits, and inspired me with interesting problems and an
    <i>enthusiasm</i> for knowledge and problem solving. Apart from my family, I'm certain
    she is the adult who made the most profound impact on my life as a child, and set me
    on the path which I cannot be thankful enough for having taken.

    I was interested in computer games and was on the web pretty early, playing RuneScape
    and whatnot, but I had no deeper understanding of computers before high school. A
    friend showed me how to make simple VisualBasic scripts with which one could make
    popup-windows with custom text, buttons, title, and icons, on any Windows machine.
    Hilarious and mature as I was, I used this knowledge when visiting random stores:
    Finding an un-supervised computer, I alt-tabbed to the desktop and created a new
    script which showed a popup saying a virus had been detected, and asking if they
    wanted to wipe C:/, Yes or No. However when clicking No the window just appeared
    again... Hiilaarious!! Clicking Yes made the window disappear without any
    side-effects, lucky for me I had not learned how to make anything more serious...

    When time came to pick a high school and for the first time "specializing" the
    studies, I like many others had no idea what I wanted to do for a living many more
    years later down the line. Something with the natural sciences, I guess, but more than
    that? How was I supposed to know how to make that choice... My student counselor
    together with my mom said:
  </p>
  <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 4px">
    Well, you like computers don't you? Maybe an IT-programme would be fun?
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>...Sure, maybe, who knows?ðŸ¤· I don't have a better idea.</blockquote>
  <p>
    Said and done, I ended up in the IT-Data programme of HulebÃ¤cksgymnasiet. In the early
    start I was actually very hesitant. Some shoe horned but necessary context: I had
    never been one of the popular kids, although I was friends with some of them. The last
    year before high school I managed to get my first girlfriend, and had started working
    out for the first time in my life, building some well needed confidence, but also for
    the first time in my life making me feel like less of a geek. This obviously clashed
    hard with committing to IT/Data, especially when the class was male-only, and large
    parts kinda nerdy. I remember clearly one of the first programming lessons we had,
    where the teacher showed us an example of using variables for storing data and
    functions for updating them:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Let's say we make a zombie shooter, then I can define the zombie health in a variable,
    and a function for when the zombie is shot. I decrease the health of the zombie with
    the damage of the gun, and if the health drops to 0 or below, I make the zombie dead.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    GREAT first example, and many classmates loved it (and really, I did too), but all I
    could think and feel was: "<i
      >This is sooo nerdy, am I really willing to give up any last chance of not being a
      geek for the rest of my life??</i
    >"<br />
    So, I seriously considered switching to just Nature or smth, but ended up staying
    because I had such a good time with my classmates, who most of them were not the least
    concerned with the impression they made on others.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this is the point I want to get at: By committing to this programme and leaning<i
      >into</i
    >
    the geek I had always been instead of trying to be someone else, I think I finally
    "found myself" and became confident in the way I today consider "cool"; Being
    Yourself.

    It did not take long before I <em>looved</em> programming and most of the related
    subjects. It felt like math, but instead of trying to understand a world built on
    axioms and the implications they created, it was more about <i>building</i> stuff
    based on logic-based tools and rules. Combined with some really interesting low-level
    hardware & logic-gates courses and more advanced natural sciences than before, I
    finally started liking school for real and felt motivated to try and continue on this
    path, for the first time setting a clear goal for myself of what I wanted to achieve
    with me education.
  </p>
  <p>
    Long story short, this interest only evolved during university, especially the last
    years advanced courses. And even though working life in the industry has been much
    different from academia, I feel extremely lucky that I found an education which I
    developed such an interest for, and which has evolved into my deepest interest in
    life. Getting paid for following my passion is so far the best foundation I could
    imagine for building a happy life, and is something I will feel deep gratitude over
    for the rest of my life.
