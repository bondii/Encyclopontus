  <h2>ðŸª´ Alcohol as a Social Lubricant</h2>

  <p>
    I grew up in Sweden, where alcohol plays an important social role, whether you like it
    or not.
  </p>
  <p>A friend once said something along the lines of:</p>
  <blockquote>
    I have some immigrant friends who say to me "<i
      >I donâ€™t get these Swedes, I'm as friendly as can be and try my best to get to know
      those I get in contact with, but we never truly connect, itâ€™s like they never let
      their walls down.</i
    >".<br />
    To which I reply "<i>Have you gone out drinking with them?"</i>, and the answer is
    <u>always</u> no.<br />
    Swedes just have that culture of a hard outer shell, and when we drink we loosen that
    shell which in turn makes us feel a bit exposed and therefore makes it easier to
    connect to other people.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I think there's a lot of truth in this. Opening up feels a bit more natual to other
    cultures, while most Swedes are not really used to and comfortable doing so. Hence,
    when we drink and do it anyways, we get that special vulnerable feeling, leading to a
    deeper connection.

  <h3>Social Relaxation</h3>
  <p>
    When a group socializes while drinking alcohol, I've often noticed the topics of
    discussion going haywire without anyone seeming to care. Obviously this is not the
    case all the time, but often enough to make me write this text. It's like the value of
    the discussion doesn't lie in <i>what</i> is being discussed, but rather just that we
    as a group are discussing and sharing thoughts for a while, filling up our
    <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Mood">Social Need bar</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assuming this to be true, I want to argue that "talking bullshit" in this sense is
    kind of equivalent to a social meditation, where one can save on precious

    (not delving deep into the intricacies of subjects often means we don't really have to
    do anything else than Level 1 or maybe Level 2 thinking), while we still get our
    social needs met, leaving us with a more balanced and content feeling when we return
    on our solo paths afterwards.
